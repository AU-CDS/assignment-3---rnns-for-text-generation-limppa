# Assignment 3 - Language modelling and text generation using RNNs

For this assignment, I have written code that trains a text generation model on the headlines of articles by The New York Times from 2017-2018. 

*Note: due to technical difficulties, the data used for training - i.e., article headlines - differs from what the original instructions for the assignment outlined. This change was approved by instructor Ross during class.*

## Instructions

To run the code, first install the requirements by running the following command in terminal: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then run the RNN model by navigating to the "src" folder and running this command: `python3 -m rnn_save.py`
